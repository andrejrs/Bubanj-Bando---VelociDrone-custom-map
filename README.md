# Bubanj Bando - VelociDrone custom map

This is Bando custom made map of Bubanj location (Kragujevac, Serbia). **Empty Scene Day** scene has been used for creating this custom made map/track.

This is empty map without track and it's ideal for freestyle traning.

In future versions, I plan to add race tracks as well.

## Getting Started

In order to run the custom map, it is necessary to install a [VelociDrone](https://www.velocidrone.com/) FPV (Racing Drone) simulator.

### Installing

1) Download bubanj.trk file 
2) Copy that file to **Documents** folder (Home folder on Mac OS X)
3) Run VelociDrone then click on Track Editor button, on next page click on Import Track
4) Select bubanj from **Empty Scene Day** scenary.
5) Have Fun! :)
